        <p class="desc">
          Midtown East Medical PC (MEMPC) is committed to reducing waste and inefficiency
          and making our billing process as simple and easy as possible. We require that you provide a credit card on file with our office.
          We run our payments through our HIPAA-compliant, secure practice management software eClinicalWorks. When you come in, we will scan your card with a card reader. Your payment information is stored on eClinicalWorks’ secure servers for future transactions. 
          Office personnel will not have access to your card. For your protection, only the last 4 digits of your card will show in our system.
        </p>

        <p class="desc">
          Credit Card on File will be used to pay account balances after insurance adjudication (i.e., Co-pay difference, Co-insurance, and deductibles). Once your insurance has processed your claims, they will send an Explanation of Benefits or Payments (EOB/EOP) to both you and our office showing your total patient responsibility. You typically receive the EOB/EOP before we do, so if you disagree with the amount owed, it is your responsibility to contact your insurance carrier immediately. 
          After insurance(s) processes the visit, a statement will be sent and if the balance is not paid within 10 days, the credit card on file will be charged.

    The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides patients with rights related to the use and disclosure of their Protected Health Information (PHI). These rights are described in the Notice of Privacy Practices (Notice). The Notice is provided to every new patient, posted in faculty practice locations, and posted on the medical center website. The Notice informs patients of their privacy rights and how to exercise their rights. Patients should be directed to or provided with the appropriate HIPAA form to make a request or file a complaint.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Patient Privacy Rights include:</strong></p>
  <ul class="desc">
    <li>The right to inspect the patient’s PHI in a designated record set and obtain a copy, including an electronic copy, of such PHI</li>

    <li>The right to choose someone to act on the patient’s behalf</li>
    <li>The right to be notified of a HIPAA Breach</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Right to Inspect and Receive a Copy of Their PHI</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    The patient's right to inspect or obtain a copy of their PHI includes some limitations:
  </p>
  <ul class="desc">
    <li>A patient must request to access, inspect, or obtain a copy of their PHI in writing to MEMPC privacy officer. Privacy Officer will respond to such request within 30 days unless extended to 60 days in accordance with HIPAA.</li>
    <li>The patient may only access, inspect, or obtain a copy of their PHI if that information is part of the designated record set.</li>
    <li>To request a copy of the patient’s PHI or to have a copy of the patient’s PHI sent to another organization or individual designated by the patient, the patient should complete the Authorization to Release Medical Information form. A copy of the authorization should be maintained in the patient’s record.</li>
    <li>Subject to certain limitations, the patient has the right to request and receive access to PHI in the form and format requested, provided the PHI is readily producible in such form and format. This includes the right to access an electronic copy of their PHI in a designated record set if the health information is maintained in an electronic format or readily producible in that form and format.</li>
    <li>MEMPC may accept verbal authorization from a parent or an adult patient to send immunization records to a school or other educational institution if the school is required by law to have proof of immunization. This verbal authorization should be documented in the medical record.</li>
    <li>The right to inspect or obtain a copy of the patient’s PHI does not include a right to copy or inspect: (i) psychotherapy notes; or (ii) information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or for use in, a civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding or action.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="desc">
    Patients may have additional rights in circumstances where MEMPC denies the patient’s access request. These may include the right to have the denial reviewed by a licensed health care professional who did not participate in the original denial. If the request is denied, the reason for the denial must be stated in writing in the medical record and the Office of Compliance should be notified.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Right to Request an Amendment of Their PHI</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    Subject to certain limitations, the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides patients with a right to amend their PHI in a designated record set. This includes patient information in any media (paper or electronic).
  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    All requests must be made in writing and include information to support the reason for the amendment. Patients should complete the Request for an Amendment of Health Information form which should be sent to Privacy Officer. A written approval or denial of the request will be sent to the patient within 60 days, unless this timeline is extended for an additional 30 days in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Patients have additional rights and MEMPC has additional obligations where MEMPC denies the patient’s amendment request. If the request for an amendment is denied by the physician, the denial will be reviewed by the Privacy Office in collaboration with the physician, etc., as necessary. Further, the patient has the right to have a Statement of Disagreement added to their health record. MEMPC may prepare a written rebuttal to this statement of disagreement. The rebuttal must be provided to the patient and added to the patient’s health record subject to the disputed amendment. Refer to the Health Information Management Policy for additional information.
  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    When Columbia receives a notification from another covered entity of an amendment to a patient’s PHI, the notification should be sent to Health Information Management. PRIVACY OFFICER will review the information to determine where the information should be indexed into the patient record.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Right to an Accounting of Disclosures</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    Subject to certain limitations, patients have a right to receive an Accounting of certain Disclosures of PHI made by MEMPC in the six years prior to the date on which the accounting is requested. Privacy Officer is responsible for receiving and processing patient requests for an Accounting of Disclosures and shall respond within 60 days unless extended an additional 30 days in compliance with HIPAA. The form to request an Accounting of Disclosures is found on the Privacy Office webpage. MEMPC is obligated to document the information required to be included in an accounting subject to an accounting request by a patient.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Right to Request Restriction on the Use or Disclosure of Their PHI</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    The HIPAA Privacy Rule grants patients the right to request restrictions regarding the use or disclosure of their PHI for certain purposes, including treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO). The rule also grants patients the right to request restrictions for other disclosures, such as those made to family members. Patients should be referred to complete the Request for Restriction on Use or Disclosure of Health Information form which should be forwarded to the Privacy Office for review.
  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    Subject to certain exceptions, MEMPC is not required to accept a restriction request, however if MEMPC agrees to the restrictions, MEMPC must comply with the restriction except in an emergency related to treatment of the patient. In addition, there are certain situations when we may not be able to comply with a request. These situations include emergency treatment, disclosures to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and certain uses and disclosures that do not require authorization.
  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    The request must be received in writing, placed in the medical record, and linked to each record of care or the appropriate episode of care. Requests to modify or terminate a restriction that may no longer be applicable should be in writing and sent to the Privacy Office. The Privacy Office will review restriction requests, maintain documentation of requests, and as necessary, conduct periodic audits to confirm the applicability.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Right to Request Restrictions on Disclosures to Their Health Plan for Services Paid for Out of Pocket</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    MEMPC must agree to a request from a patient to restrict certain disclosures of the patient’s PHI to the patient’s health plan if the disclosure of the PHI pertains solely to a health care service and the patient has paid in full for the service out of pocket.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Request for Communications at an Alternate Location or by Alternate Means</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    Patients may request to receive communication related to their medical information in a certain way (e.g., by phone only) or at a certain location (e.g., use work address). Patients who request communications at an alternate location or by alternate means should be referred to complete the Request for Restriction on Use or Disclosure of Health Information form and requests should be forwarded to the Privacy Officer who will review with the related provider / practice manager to determine if the request can be accommodated.
  </p>

  <p class="desc"><strong>Right to a Paper Copy of the Notice Of Privacy Practice (NOPP)</strong></p>
  <p class="desc">
    MEMPC is responsible for maintaining paper copies of the Notice. A patient has the right to receive a paper copy of the Notice upon request. Staff can obtain copies of the Notice by contacting the Privacy Officer.
  </p>

  <p class="desc">
    The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides patients with the right to file a complaint with MEMPC and with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The contact information for OCR is included in the Notice. Upon receipt of the patient complaint, the Privacy Office will investigate and, as necessary, provide notification to the patient regarding the determinations.
  </p>
